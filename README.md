## About the project

Wa all have a lot of photos and videos, may be a lot more than "a lot", and you save them in the cloud, but these services are paid and they get full quickly. Then, why don't have it in your home in a mini PC where you can upload, download and preview the images/videos in without getting worried about the price and if you have internet, because your mini pc will be in your local network.


## Usage

As this will be a physical server you will need a mini pc in your home. This mini pc will be plug and play. May be will have an integrated display to use the first steps of the installation/configuration. Then you will connect to your server and create a user. And finally upload your images/videos.
